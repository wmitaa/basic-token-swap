# Basic Token Swap Contract

## 1. Project Title
**Basic Token Swap (Clarity Smart Contract)**

## 2. Project Description
This is a simple Clarity smart contract that allows users to swap between two fungible tokens (Token A and Token B) on the Stacks blockchain.  
The contract supports a **1:1 swap ratio** for simplicity, making it easy to exchange tokens without external price oracles.

The project is minimal and includes only **two core functions**:
- `swap-token-a-for-token-b`
- `swap-token-b-for-token-a`

## 3. Project Vision
Our vision is to create a foundation for **decentralized token swaps** on the Stacks blockchain that can be expanded into a more advanced decentralized exchange (DEX).  
This contract serves as a starting point for developers to integrate token swaps into their projects.

## 4. Future Scope
- Integrate with price oracles for dynamic swap rates.
- Support multiple token pairs.
- Add transaction fees for liquidity providers.
- Implement liquidity pools and automated market making (AMM).
- Add safety checks for liquidity balance before swaps.
